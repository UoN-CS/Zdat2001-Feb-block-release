# Overview
This repository is designed for the Collaborative Git Hands-On Session, where we will practice feature branching, merging, resolving conflicts, and Git best practices. The session will demonstrate how teams can work collaboratively on the same project while maintaining a structured workflow.

We will use a data pipeline script (data_pipeline.py) that processes air quality data from raw_data.csv. Throughout the session, participants will:

- Create feature branches for independent development.
- Make changes and push commits to the repository.
- Open and merge pull requests.
- Resolve merge conflicts that arise from simultaneous edits.
